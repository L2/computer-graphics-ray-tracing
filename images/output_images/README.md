# Sample output images


These sample output images were generated with the following settings. **Please use these values in your submission!**
* `max_num_recursive_calls` constant = `10`
    * i.e. reflect up to 10 times
    * You should define this in `raycolor.cpp`.
* "fudge factor" epsilon value of `1e-6`
    * Used when preventing self-intersection during reflection or shadowing.
    * See assignment `README.md` for more info.
* Ambient light constant `ia = .1` (see `blinn_phong_shading.h`)
    * Material `ka` determines the ambient colour and we use `ia` to tune the intensity.
